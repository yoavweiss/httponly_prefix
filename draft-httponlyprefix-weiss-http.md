--- abstract

This draft introduces the __HttpOnly and __HostHttpOnly cookie name prefixes
that ensure the cookie was set with an HttpOnly attribute.

# Introduction

There are cases where it's important to distinguish on the server side
between cookies {{COOKIES}} that were set by the server and
ones that were set by the client.

One such case is cookies that are normally *always* set by the server,
unless some unexpected code (an XSS exploit, a malicious extension, a
commit from a confused developer, etc.) happens to set them on the client.

This draft add a signal that would enable servers to make such a distinction.

More specifically, it defines the __HttpOnly and __HostHttpOnly prefixes,
that make sure that a cookie is not set on the client side using script.

## Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Server Requirements

These requirements apply to cookies set in `Set-Cookie` response headers by the server,
as well as ones received in a `Cookie` request header from the client.

## Cookie Name Prefixes

### The "__HttpOnly-" prefix

#### Cookie creation

If a server creates a cookie whose name begins with a case-sensitive match for
the string `__HttpOnly-`, then all the following MUST be true:

1. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header MUST include the `Secure` attribute.
2. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header MUST include the `HttpOnly` attribute.

#### Cookie processing

If a server processes a cookie received in a `Cookie` request header whose name begins with a case-sensitive
match for the string `__HttpOnly-`, this indicates that **all** the following are true:

1. The cookie was originally created using a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header sent from this server.
2. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header included the `Secure` attribute.
3. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header included the `HttpOnly` attribute.

### The "__HostHttpOnly-" prefix

#### Cookie creation

If a server uses a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header to create a cookie whose name begins with a case-sensitive match for
the string `__HostHttpOnly-`, then all the following MUST be true:

1. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header MUST include the `Secure` attribute.
2. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header MUST include the `HttpOnly` attribute.
3. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header MUST include the `Path` attribute with a value of `/`.
4. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header MUST NOT include the `Domain` attribute.

#### Cookie processing

If a server processes a cookie received in a `Cookie` request header whose name begins with a case-sensitive
match for the string `__HttpOnlyHost-`, this indicates that **all** the following are true:

1. The cookie was originally created using a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header sent from this server
2. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header included the `Secure` attribute.
3. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header included the `HttpOnly` attribute.
4. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header included the `Path` attribute with a value of `/`.
5. The `Set-Cookie` HTTP header did not include the `Domain` attribute.

# User Agent Requirements

These requirements apply to cookies received in a `Set-Cookie` response header from the server.

## Cookie Name Prefixes
User agents' requirements for cookie name prefixes differ slightly from servers', as UAs MUST match the prefix string case-insensitively.

### Storage Model
Add the following steps after step 21 of section 5.7 in {{COOKIES}}.

1. If the cookie-name begins with a case-insensitive match for the string "__HttpOnly-",
   1. Abort these steps and ignore the cookie entirely unless all the following conditions are true:
      1. The cookie's `secure-only-flag` is true.
      1. The cookie's `http-only-flag` is true.
      1. The `cookie-attribute-list` contains an attribute with an `attribute-name` of "Path", and the cookie's path is "/".

1. If the cookie-name begins with a case-insensitive match for the string "__HostHttpOnly-",
   1. Abort these steps and ignore the cookie entirely unless all the following conditions are true:
      1. The cookie's `secure-only-flag` is true.
      1. The cookie's `http-only-flag` is true.
      1. The cookie's `host-only-flag` is true.
      1. The `cookie-attribute-list` contains an attribute with an `attribute-name` of "Path", and the cookie's path is "/".
      1. The `cookie-attribute-list` does not contain an attribute with an `attribute-name` of "Domain".

# Security Considerations

There are no particular security considerations.
These new prefixes will only limit the ability of non-compliant cookies to be set.
They do not open up new capabilities for server to set cookies where they previously could not.


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
