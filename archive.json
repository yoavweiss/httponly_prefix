HttpOnly\n\nBut last option doesn't covered by `__Host` so I need to add `HttpOnly` too.\n\n```\nSet-Cookie: __Host-session_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx; HttpOnly; Max-Age=${maxage}\n```\n\nSo your suggestion for `__HttpOnlyHost` is `__Session` for me.\n\n```\nSet-Cookie: __Session-id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; Max-Age=${maxage}\n```\n\nAnd it explicitly shows it's Cookie for Session Management.\nSo I'd love to propose alternative naming for your proposal.\nThanks.\n",
