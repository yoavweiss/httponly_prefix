1.  Introduction

   There are cases where it's important to distinguish on the server
   side between cookies [COOKIES] that were set by the server and ones
   that were set by the client.

   One such case is cookies that are normally _always_ set by the
   server, unless some unexpected code (an XSS exploit, a malicious
   extension, a commit from a confused developer, etc.) happens to set
   them on the client.

   This draft add a signal that would enable servers to make such a
   distinction.

   More specifically, it defines the __HttpOnly and __HttpOnlyHost
   prefixes, that make sure that a cookie is not set on the client side
   using script.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Server Requirements

2.1.  Cookie Name Prefixes

2.1.1.  The "__HttpOnly-" prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __HttpOnly-, then the cookie MUST also be:

   1) Using a Set-Cookie HTTP header. 2) With the Secure attribute. 3)
   With the HttpOnly attribute.

2.1.2.  The "__HttpOnlyHost-" prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __HttpOnlyHost-, then the cookie MUST also be:

   1) Using a Set-Cookie HTTP header. 2) With the Secure attribute. 3)
   With the HttpOnly attribute. 4) A Path attribute with a value of /,
   and no Domain attribute.

3.  User Agent Requirements

3.1.  Cookie Name Prefixes

   User agents' requirements for cookie name prefixes differ slightly
   from servers', as UAs MUST match the prefix string case-
   insensitively.

3.1.1.  Storage Model

   Add the following steps after step 21 of section 5.7 in [COOKIES].

   1.  If the cookie-name begins with a case-insensitive match for the
       string "__HttpOnly-",

       1.  Abort these steps and ignore the cookie entirely unless all
           the following conditions are true:

           1.  The cookie's secure-only-flag is true.

           2.  The cookie's http-only-flag is true.

   2.  If the cookie-name begins with a case-insensitive match for the
       string "__HttpOnly-",

       1.  Abort these steps and ignore the cookie entirely unless all
           the following conditions are true:

           1.  The cookie's secure-only-flag is true.

           2.  The cookie's http-only-flag is true.

           3.  The cookie's host-only-flag is true.

           4.  The cookie-attribute-list contains an attribute with an
               attribute-name of "Path", and the cookie's path is /

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no particular security considerations.  These new prefixes
   will only limit the ability of non-compliant cookies to be set.  They
   do not open up new capabilities for server to set cookies where they
   previously could not.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
