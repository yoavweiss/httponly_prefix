1.  Introduction

   There are cases where it's important to distinguish on the server
   side between cookies that were set by the server and ones that were
   set by the client.  One such case are cookies that are normally
   _always_ set by the server, unless some unexpected code (an XSS
   exploit, a malicious extension, a commit from a confused developer,
   etc) happens to set them on the client.

   This draft add a signal that would enable servers to make such a
   distinction.

   More specifically, it defines the __HttpOnly and __HttpOnlyHost
   prefixes, that make sure that a cookie is not set on the client side
   using script.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Cookie Name Prefixes

2.1.  The "__HttpOnly-" prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __HttpOnly-, then the cookie will only be set if the cookie is set:

   1) Using a Set-Cookie HTTP header. 2) With the Secure attribute. 3)
   With the HttpOnly attribute.

2.2.  The "__HttpOnlyHost-" prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __HttpOnly-, then the cookie will only be set if the cookie is set:

   1) Using a Set-Cookie HTTP header. 2) With the Secure attribute. 3)
   With the HttpOnly attribute. 4) A Path attribute with a value of /,
   and no Domain attribute.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no particular security considerations.  These new prefixes
   will only limit the ability of non-compliant cookies to be set.  They
   do not open up new capabilities for server to set cookies where they
   previously could not.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
